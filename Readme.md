### In class project (Programming Technique)
This game is my first java mini game project which gather all the things in lecture to practice.
You can download .apk file in /android/release

## What I learn from this project
- Using LibGDX for making this
- Intensify mind blowing OOP
- Animation concept
- Game Design
- Asset management
- Project management (This project had only 1 month deadline ðŸ’€)
- **Add event listener to button**

###### P.S. The entire code may be **ugly** because of lacking of time to review.
